React.FC -> type of functional component & React.ReactNode supports all  of the typesd (const App: React.FC = () => {})


=====================================================

Thunks are used to cintro the Aysnc ops in workflow
They return a function in which you can do an API call
also they have middleware which can be used to keep check of any side effects the function might have


we use ClassName in React because class is reserved word in Javascript so we will be creating else but not style with classname
babel is converts sooo
=====================================================

google thing core web vitals
tHEY ARE used in ranking factors for the website the better the score 

Total Blocking Time (TBT) is a non-Core Web Vital that measures the total time in milliseconds between First Contentful Paint (FCP) and 
While TBT can be gathered in the field, it’s easily influenced by user interaction and doesn’t make for a reliable metric to measure how long it takes for a page to become responsive to user input. 
Therefore, TBT is only used in lab data.Time To Interactive (TTI) where the main thread is blocked long enough to make it unresponsive to user input.


Speed Index (SI)
Speed Index (SI) is a non-Core Web Vital that measures how quickly the contents of a page are visibly populated during page load. 
It’s calculated using frame-by-frame analysis of your page’s load behavior, 
counting the visual progression between frames captured every 100ms.


loading of the website: LCP : largest contentful paint
performance 2.5 seconds to get that good rating
so here how uch time does it take the content to load the more the content , lower the score so use optimized images


FID  : First Input Delay : 100ms interactivity
time it takes from first user input to the response form the website ,
the use can see and click but the functonality isnt loaded 
real live interaction is required in order to measure this , gathers over time 
-> heavy JS , element is heavily relaint on JS and it isnt loaded , break it up to chunks 


CLS : cummulative layout shift: how stable your UI is compnonents jump as page is loading
all the layout shift that happens while scrolling and loading link appears to move or an element move over the lifespan of the website 
_> height and width is not defined , like reserve the space for the image please, some kinda placeholder 
_> animations and not induce any elements above the existing content and like make it appear as expected 

they comapre all the pages that there are and 75% ke uppar hona chaiye-> good rating
changes overtime 

=====================================================

SSR ->
1. SEO matters 
2. Takes a lot of server rendering
3. if interet is slow it will cause some issues 
4. it is generally for static contents like a blog site, fast inital loading 
5. prepared so browser is not dependednt

CSR -> 
1. where lot of user interaction is required 
2. SEO is not that important

Since most of the nowadays frameworks do allow this then we can use the combo
